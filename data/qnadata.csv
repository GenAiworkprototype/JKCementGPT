What is RAG system?,"A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a paradigm in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that combines generative and retrieval systems. In its traditional form, it works by retrieving relevant documents or information from external sources (like a database or search engine). This retrieved external knowledge is then used by a generative model to produce responses that are more relevant and contextual."
What is decision-making loop?,"In the context of Agentic RAG, a decision-making loop is a context-aware process that decides how to process and use retrieved information. Guided by the system's goals and priorities, these loops evaluate the retrieved data, determine its relevance, and decide on the best response to align with the task's objectives."
Explain feedback loop mechanisms.,"Feedback loop mechanisms are a central feature of Agentic RAG that enable iterative and continuous learning. Unlike traditional systems where the process ends after a response is generated , these loops allow the system to evaluate its generated content against the desired goals. Based on this feedback, the system refines its performance by adjusting both its retrieval and generation processes in real-time."
